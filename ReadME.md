Week 1 Code Challenge
This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges. Each challenge is placed in its own folder: challenge1, challenge2, and challenge3. Below are the details of each challenge and their respective solutions.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Problem Statement
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 50 to 59
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40

Solution
The solution to this challenge can be found in challenge1/StudentGradeGenerator.js.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Problem Statement
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "License suspended".

Solution
The solution to this challenge can be found in challenge2/SpeedDetector.js


Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Problem Statement
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
